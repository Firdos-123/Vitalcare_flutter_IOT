# VitalCare: A Smart IoT-Based Health Monitoring Application

## 📖 Project Description

VitalCare is a mobile health monitoring app built using Flutter, Firebase, and IoT technology. It allows patients to track their vital signs like temperature, humidity, heartbeat, and SPO2 in real-time, while also enabling caregivers to monitor the patient's health remotely. The app includes chatbot support, downloadable health reports, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Short Overview)

- Patients sign up with email and OTP, enter health details, and receive a unique Patient ID.
- Caregivers use this ID to log in and view the patient’s vitals.
- IoT sensors send real-time health data to Blynk, which is fetched by the app and displayed in cards and graphs.
- Data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database for tracking and report generation.
- The chatbot provides basic health guidance and navigation help.
